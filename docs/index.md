# lke-operator

## Overview
The lke-operator is a Kubernetes operator designed to manage Linode Kubernetes Engine (LKE) clusters. It automates the provisioning, scaling, and management of LKE clusters, simplifying the deployment and maintenance process for Kubernetes workloads on Linode's infrastructure.

## Description
The lke-operator streamlines the deployment and management of LKE clusters. It allows users to define their desired LKE cluster configuration using Kubernetes custom resources, which are then reconciled by the operator to ensure the actual cluster matches the desired state.
